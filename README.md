# Prompt Lib

Welcome to my ever-growing collection of prompts—because sometimes, staring at a blank screen just isn't inspiring enough. Whether you're looking for a spark to kickstart a story, a quirky idea for a coding project, or just an excuse to procrastinate productively, this repo has something for you. Some of these prompts are practical, some are a little weird, and a few probably say more about me than I'd like to admit. 

Feel free to use them as-is, modify them to fit your needs, or just read through them and wonder how I got here. Either way, I hope they help you create something interesting. If you have ideas for new prompts, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue—collaboration makes everything better (except group projects in school, those were the worst).

Got a prompt idea that deserves a spot here? Open an issue or submit a pull request. No idea is too wild—unless it's *really* wild, in which case, I'm still probably interested.
