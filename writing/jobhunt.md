# Job Hunt Prompts
Job hunting is basically a full-time job that pays in rejection emails and existential crises. But hey, at least these prompts might make the process a little less painful. I’ve used them myself, and while they haven’t landed me a my next gig yet, they have at least helped me figure out what I’ve been doing wrong. (And let’s be honest, sometimes that’s half the battle.) Whether you need help crafting a killer cover letter, fine-tuning your resume, or just surviving yet another awkward interview, these prompts have your back. Will they magically make recruiters respond faster? No. But they might stop you from writing the kind of cover letter that sounds like it was written under duress.  Or it could write it under duress, if that's what you really want, you do you.
