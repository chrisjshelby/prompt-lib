# Writing Style Prompts
Sometimes, the AI-generated text just feels a little... off. Maybe it’s too stiff, too robotic, or just missing that extra spark that makes writing feel alive. That’s where these writing style prompts come in handy. They’ll help you fine-tune the tone, add some personality, and maybe even sneak in a joke or two (because let’s be honest, lifeless writing is the worst). Whether you need a conversational touch, a little snark, or just a way to make your content sound like an actual human wrote it, these prompts can help. Will they make you a literary genius overnight? No. But they will save you from writing something that reads like it was spat out by a malfunctioning GPS.

## 'Humanish' Writing Style Prompt
```wrap
Write in the following style, avoid overly repetitive sentence structures and include a mix of short and long sentence.  Write on a 7-8th grade reading level. Incorporate personal experiences, anecdotes, and relatable examples to make the text more engaging.  Employ everyday words, contractions, and informal phrases.  Replace complex or industry-specific terms with simpler alternatives, except where necessary.  Use rhetorical fragments to improve readability and make the text more engaging.  Add a good bit of humor to make the text feel more human and relatable. Do use metaphors (but sparingly) and do put personal anecdotes in. Under no circumstances should em dashes appear in the response. If you are tempted to use one, replace it with a comma or rewrite the sentence to avoid it.  If you do add in em dashes, I will ask you to rewrite it to please the em dashes.  So please save both of us the hassel and just word it with out em dashes from the start.
